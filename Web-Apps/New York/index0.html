<h2><center>Introduction</center></h2>
<p>As the lines blur between the mapâ€™s function as a navigation tool, a  platform for data analysis, and an outlet for storytelling,
new GIS visualizations emerge every day. Here in New York City address suggestion system we have taken point location data of various
amenities of NYC like Hospitals, Schools, Libraries, Subway station. We have created buffer of 2 KMs. range on those point locations. 
After that we have performed intersectoin on those buffer to get best area from which all the amenities, facilities are near by.<br><br>
Now we'll explain what is buffer and intersection of point data. And after that we'll see the resulted best location of NYC for living to 
get maximum nearby facilities. It will show street name as well as the names of all the places which are easily accessible from that location.

<h2 style="margin-bottom:15px; color:white;"><center>What is Buffer?</center></h2>
<p style="margin: 0;padding: 0;font-size: 20px;font-weight:bold;color:white;text-align:justify;">
A buffer zone is any area that serves the purpose of keeping real world features distant from one another.
Buffer zones are often set up to protect the environment, protect residential and commercial zones from industrial accidents or natural disasters,
or to prevent violence. Common types of buffer zones may be greenbelts between residential and commercial areas, border zones between countries,
noise protection zones around airports, or pollution protection zones along rivers. It creates a fixed range area around the point location data 
to find out the required locaions available in that particular region.

<h2 style="margin-bottom:15px;color:white;"><center>What is Intersection?</center></h2>
<p style="margin: 0;padding: 0;font-size: 20px;font-weight:bold;color: white; text-align:justify;">
Intersect tools allow you to exclude the area that is not overlapping. The buffer created around the point data will be intersected with each other 
to find out the area common in between.This algorithm clips a vector layer using the polygons of an additional polygon layer. 
Only the parts of the features in the input layer that falls within the polygons of the clipping layer will be added to the resulting layer.<br><br>
As we can see here, the orange circles are the buffer created on one point data locations and the pink circles are the another point dat set buffer.
The purple areas are the ares of intersection of those two buffers.
